      <h1>Why I made this website?</h1>
      <p>I have made this website as one of my projects. This website is just for fun. I always had a dream to build a website and an app of my own which can be seen (website) and downloaded (app). And I have achieved the first milestone of making a website. After learning javascript, I will try to learn java for android development and make android apps. Making this website was fun and it also helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills. I was able to learn many things while creating this. I hope you liked it.</p>
